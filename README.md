# password_generator


password generator using javascript to ask users for various criteria held in arrays.

Depending on the chosen password length and criteria, I used a for loop to randomly generate a string which is then added to the html page using another function.

Also, I have added a second button to the page that will allow users to copy the generated password to their clipboard.
